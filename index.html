                <p>Linus Benedict Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer. He is best known for being 
                the <b>creator of the Linux Operating System</b>. He was born in Helsinki, Finland, on the 28th of 
                December 1969. Though Finnish by birth, he later became a naturalized American citizen. Linus 
                Torvalds has made significant contributions to computing through the creation of the Linux kernel 
                and, later, the development of the Git control system. His creation of Linux transformed computing 
                and software development through its open-source, collaborative approach.</p> <br>
                
                <p>Linus Torvalds is a software engineer who is the creator and principal developer of the Linux kernel, which is the kernel for a number of operating systems. He also created the version control system Git. Torvalds was born on 
                December 28, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland. He studied computer science at the University of Helsinki, and he developed the Linux kernel as a student project in 1991. Since then, the Linux kernel has become one of the most widely used kernels in 
                the world, powering everything from smartphones to supercomputers. He has become one of the largest 
                free software projects in the world.</p> <br>

                <p>Linus Torvalds started developing the operating system that became Linux because he could not get a copy 
                of the Unix OS for his computer to replace MS-DOS. Torvalds wanted an OS that could take full 
                advantage of the 386 processor. He tried to use a copy of Minix he procured through academic 
                contacts. This also did not meet his needs as it was not fully open-source. </p>

                <p>Linus Torvalds is a Finnish software engineer who is the creator and, historically, the lead 
                    developer of the Linux kernel, used by Linux distributions and other operating systems such 
                    as Android. He also created the distributed version control system Git.
                    He was honored, along with Shinya Yamanaka, with the 2012 Millennium Technology Prize by the 
                    Technology Academy Finland "in recognition of his creation of a new open source operating system 
                    for computers leading to the widely used Linux kernel.</p>
